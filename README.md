##The project is a Netflix clone build with React and Firebase.##

This is a advance project that I complete with major help from my instructor Karl Hadwen - @karlhadwen - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1DUQiZduv_yNZy0O7n_iHA .

Note: the project is complete, it just need lot of images to render which I believe not nessesary.   


Things I learned building this project.

- Application architecture and design pattern for real-word application like Netflix.

- Combine compound component design and "styled-component" library to create a well-organize, easy to maintain code base.

- Combine context hook api and Firebase firestore to render user data.

- Use Firebase as a backend for user authentication and data storage. This include Signup, Login, Logout, and user validation.

- Create custom Hook for user validation.

- Use Fuse.js library for quick client-side search without using back-end.


The most valuable lesson is combining compound component and "styled-component" library. Which teach me how to organize files, folders, reuse component, and style component without tons of css files.
